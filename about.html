                        My name is Devin Castillo. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Computer Science. <br>
                        I have wanted to learn about Compter Science ever since I was in 6th grade. In highschool, I started learnign about Web Design and I had so much fun creating my website.

                        I am a huge football fan. My favorite team is the Los Angeles Rams. Though I knew about it before, I really got into football in 2019. It did not take long for me to choose my favorite team. Now, the football season is one of my favorite times of the year.
                    </p>

                        Something else about me is that I am a video editor. One summer in highschool, I really wanted to learn how to edit videos. I watch a lot of tutorials about how to edit on Davinci Resolve.I took long streams from streamers I used to watch, and turn them in to 20 minute edited videos. My videos were good enough for me to get a job for one of these streamers.
